# 	1. Create a class called Animal that accepts two numbers as inputs and assigns them respectively to two instance variables: arms and legs. 
# 	Create an instance method called limbs that, when called, returns the total number of limbs the animal has. 
# 	To the variable name spider, assign an instance of Animal that has 4 arms and 4 legs. 
# 	Call the limbs method on the spider instance and save the result to the variable name spidlimbs.
